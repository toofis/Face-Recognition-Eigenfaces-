# Face-Recognition_eigenfaces

Dataset : 20 different people with 10 face images of each one. 70% used for training and 30% for testing.
For every face feature matrix is extracted, data are projected on the eigenvector space. Weight matrix is trained and ECC is used for categorisation.
A face is recognised as the closest to the trained feature images.
